I have observed "url","title","meta_description" and "form". These are useful to see the websites link, title of the website, a short description of the website's contents and if the website contains a form. You can also see the "status", showing is connection to the sever was successful, "server" showing what server you are accessing, if that information is provided, and "content type" showing what content is on the website. One defensive use of this information would be to hide which version of the server is being used. This would be useful as if a potential attacker knew which specific veresion was being used they could more accurately target certain weaknesses prone to that version of the server. Some ethical precautions you must follow when performing similar reconnaissance are 1) have permission from the company or server cliet you are scanning and 2) avoid causing damage to the server or company.
