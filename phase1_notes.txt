Step-1 - Quick HTTP header check with curl
Q1) I got status line "HTTP/1.1/200 OK". This means the request was successful.
Q2) The server header value was "Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)". This is specific.

Step-2 - Fetch the full page body
Q1) The <title> is "Go ahead and ScanMe!
Q2) <form class="nst-search" id="nst-foot-search" action="/search/">
    <input class="nst-search-q" name="q" type="search" placeholder="Site Search">
        <button class="nst-search-button" title="Search">
            <img style="width:100%;aspect-ratio:1/1;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="/shared/images/nst-icons.svg#search">
        </button>
    </form>
    It's atributes are to search.

Step-3 - Compare curl and requests
Q1) Yes - Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
Q2) It was the same.

Step-4: Inspect headers with a different User-Agent
Q1) Yes, Content length went up from 172 - 177.
Q2) That specific users that can be accessed have more access to websites and could penetrate firewalls etc.

Step-5 - Short synthesis
Q1) The three most useful pieces of information from the above scanning would be inspecting the header with different user agents.
    This is useful to see if you can gain greather access to a website. The second would be Curl requests. This is useful to see what specific
    version of the website is being used. The third would be HTTP header checks, because you could see if the reuest was successful or not.
    A defensive suggestion would be to not show which specific version of the website is being used.
